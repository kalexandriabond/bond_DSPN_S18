    "Performing successfully in a volatile environment requires making fast, accurate decisions and updating those decisions given environmental feedback. However, accumulator models of choice-making, which model mechanisms internal to the decision, and reinforcement learning models, which involve how the outcome of those choices influence decision updates, are often isolated, despite their complementary roles in forging adaptive behavior. To more fully understand decision making and learning in a dynamic environment, I plan to explore how value conflict between competing actions (the degree to which the value associated with each action is similar) and the volatility of feedback (the change point frequency of mean value-action associations) influence adaptive decision making using a combined reinforcement learning and drift diffusion model. Specifically, quasi-Bayesian estimates of the value difference between targets [$B$] and change point probability [$\\Omega$] will serve as learning signals to update decision making parameters under conditions of varying volatility and conflict.
